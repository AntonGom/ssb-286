   <div class="parent">
       <p>Miami Vice was founded in 1981, The founders of this place wanted to have a bar and a restuarnt at the same time while having unique and nostalgic ambience. At the time of it's founding, Miami Vice was living hrough the 80's and prospering, we had have many famous celeberties stop by and visit us and our clients right at our doorstep. In 2010, we decided to remodel the place but still keep its old retro vibe. Miami Vice is a cohesive combination between old and new. </p>
